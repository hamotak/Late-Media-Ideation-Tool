/**
 * Safe read-only SQL executor for Claude.
 *
 * Hard rules:
 *   - Only SELECT / WITH statements
 *   - Only whitelisted tables (videos, channels, transcripts, comments,
 *     chat_sessions, chat_messages)
 *   - Caps rows returned
 *   - Disallows comments + multiple statements (defence-in-depth against
 *     prompt-injected `;DELETE …`)
 *
 * Channel scoping (CRITICAL — multi-channel users had cross-channel leaks):
 *   - The active channel is auto-injected as CTE shadows of `videos`,
 *     `transcripts`, and `comments`. Claude can write `SELECT … FROM
 *     videos …` as usual and it transparently sees only the active
 *     channel's rows. Same for transcripts and comments (joined through
 *     videos.id). The underlying tables remain accessible as `main.<name>`
 *     ONLY through our own CTE definitions — Claude can't reach them.
 *   - If there's no active channel, raw_sql is rejected outright. Better
 *     than silently returning empty (Claude can't tell the difference
 *     between "no rows match" and "the tool was blocked").
 *   - The `channels` table is NOT auto-scoped — Claude needs to list
 *     channels for context. That's safe: it's metadata, no per-channel
 *     numbers leak.

  handle TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  subscriber_count INTEGER,
  view_count INTEGER,
  video_count INTEGER,
  imported_at INTEGER
)
-- This is the only NOT auto-scoped table. Use it when you need the
-- active channel's metadata or to list which other channels are
-- connected.

transcripts (
  video_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,       -- FK to videos.id
  language TEXT,
  text TEXT NOT NULL,
  fetched_at INTEGER
)
-- AUTO-SCOPED: only transcripts of videos belonging to the active
-- channel are visible.

comments (

  video_id TEXT NOT NULL,          -- FK to videos.id
  parent_id TEXT,                  -- NULL for top-level, else parent comment id

Useful idioms:
- datetime(published_at, 'unixepoch')
- strftime('%Y-%m', datetime(published_at, 'unixepoch')) for month bucketing
- AVG/MAX/MIN/COUNT for aggregates
- json_each(tags) for tag-level analysis
