 *      A second concurrent caller sees the lock and returns 200 {skipped}.
 *      A lock older than STALE_LOCK_SEC is treated as crashed and reclaimed.
 *   2. Loop: claim the oldest queued row → mark 'syncing' →
 *      run Apify sync FIRST (resolves channel_id) → THEN YT enrich
 *      (needs channel_id to fetch subs + avatar) → mark 'synced' or
 *      'failed' → kick similarity scoring (fire-and-forget so a failure
 *      there doesn't taint the sync result).
 *   3. After draining: scan for synced rows with NULL metadata older
 *      than STALE_META_SEC — those got the old enrich-before-sync race
 *      and need a fresh enrichment pass.
 *   4. Release the lock.
