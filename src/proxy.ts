/**
 * Basic Auth gate for cloud deploys.
 *
 * (This file used to be `src/middleware.ts` — Next 16 deprecated that
 * convention in favour of `proxy.ts` with the same shape. Same idea,
 * just a renamed entry point.)
 *
 * Locally we don't want a login dialog every time `npm run dev` runs, so
 * the proxy is a no-op when `APP_USERNAME` / `APP_PASSWORD` are unset.
 * On Railway / production we set both env vars and the browser shows
 * its native HTTP Basic prompt — minimal UI, zero React work, same
 * credentials cached for the whole session.
 *
 * Why Basic Auth and not a form login: this is a single-tenant demo gate.
 * One known user, one credential, no signup flow. Anything more would be
 * over-engineered for the use case. If we ever ship multi-user we'll
 * swap this out for a real auth provider.
 *
 * Runs on the Edge runtime (default in Next 16). We use `atob()` instead
 * of `Buffer.from()` to stay Edge-compatible.
