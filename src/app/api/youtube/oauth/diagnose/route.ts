/**
 * Diagnostic helper for "why does this channel still 403 even though I
 * connected an account?". Pulls three independent signals so the user
 * can see exactly what went wrong:
 *
 *   1. tokens.scope — which scopes the saved tokens actually carry
 *      (catches the case where the user unticked monetary on the
 *      Google consent screen).
 *   2. userinfo.email — which Google account actually authorized
 *      (catches the case where Google's account picker silently picked
 *      the wrong account).
 *   3. channels.list?mine=true — which YouTube channels that Google
 *      account actually owns (catches Manager-tier vs Owner; if the
 *      target channel isn't in this list the user is at most a
 *      Manager, not an Owner).
 *
 * No side effects — purely read calls to Google. Safe to spam-run.
