 * For new chats, the mode whitelist is authoritative; groups can default
 * to every group (`["ideation","my_channel","studio_analytics"]`) and the
 * mode filter narrows down to the per-mode subset.
 *
 * For old chats without a mode, the absence of `mode` collapses to

When generate_ideas returns 409 (\"Only N outliers ≥X× in last W days…\"), STOP and ask the user: \"Widen the window (try 60d) or lower the multiplier (try 1×)? Pick one.\" Wait for their choice, then pass those exact params. Auto-loosening is the single most reliable way to ship bad ideas.",
